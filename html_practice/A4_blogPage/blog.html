                The Kerala backwaters are a network of brackish lagoons and canals lying parallel to the Arabian Sea of the Malabar coast of Kerala state in south-western India.
                It also includes interconnected lakes, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km (560 mi) of waterways,
                and sometimes compared to bayous. The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both man made and natural, fed by 38 rivers,
                and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across
                the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises.[4] There are 34 backwaters in Kerala.
                Out of it, 27 are located either closer to Arabian Sea or parallel to the sea. The remaining 7 are inland navigation routes.

                My journey began with a peaceful houseboat ride along the serene backwaters. Kottayam is known for its picturesque network of rivers, canals, and lagoons.
                Unlike the bustling backwaters of Alleppey, the ones in Kottayam offer a more tranquil experience, with fewer crowds and more opportunities to soak in the natural beauty.
                As I drifted along the waterways, I couldn’t help but marvel at the sight of coconut trees swaying gently in the breeze and the occasional sighting of water birds.

                The houseboat experience was nothing short of magical. The slow pace allowed me to fully immerse myself in the surroundings.
                As the sun began to set, the golden light reflected off the water, creating a breathtaking view that I’ll never forget.
                The gentle sounds of water and the chirping of birds made it a perfect way to unwind and start my Kottayam adventure.
